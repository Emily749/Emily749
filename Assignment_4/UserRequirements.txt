This aim of this collection manager is to create a system for tracking data for charity clubs. This is inspired by my personal involvement with the charity Space 2 Be Me – which is a charity that supports children with disabilities. We run many clubs for different ages and need a more efficient way of storing data such as attendees for a particular session, and also information about those attendees that allows all staff and volunteers to easily view information needed to support them properly. The current system is a scattered collection of messages from parents that aren’t organised and that cannot be updated or viewed by multiple people.
